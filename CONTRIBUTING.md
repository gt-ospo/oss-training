# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this open source training. Please review these guidelines for the project so that you can most effectively engage with the developers and maintainers of the project. 

The license for the project is Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0. 

## Types of Contributions Accepted

This open source training is meant to encapsulate common OSS topics in a Jupyter notebook format. We gladly accept patches to fix bugs in the notebooks, documentation improvements, feature requests, and even topics that should be included.

### Contribution Process
In general, to contribute fixes or new code, you would do the following:
1) Fork the repo
2) Make your changes and run any unit tests locally to see that changes do not break anything
3) Open a PR and fill in the PR template with relevant information on your changes.
5) Request reviewers and discuss/update the PR until it is ready to be accepted.

### Reporting Bugs

**NOTE**: If you find a security vulnerability in the codebase, please use GitHub's security mechanisms to report the issue. This provides the development team an opportunity to respond to your findings and prepare a patch that can be released to mitigate any vulnerabilities. See SECURITY.md for more details.

Other bugs can be reported via the standard issue template.

### Suggesting Features or Enhancements

If there is a feature that you would like to see in this training, please create a new issue for further discussion with the maintainers. 

## Review Process

We will aim to review your PR in 1-2 weeks with a goal of getting it merged within that time frame. If added changes are needed, we will follow up via the PR request and may make some suggestions to help your PR pass the CI unit tests and be able to be merged into the main branch. 

### Code style conventions

We currently have strong checks for code formatting but please try to be consistent with the existing codebase with your changes in terms of file naming and fixes to notebooks.
