## üöÄ Getting Started

### üíª Running Locally

All training notebooks require the `jupyter` Python package. Some may require additional packages (such as `bash_kernel`). See the intro section of each notebook for details.

```bash
pip install jupyter jupyterlab bash_kernel
python -m bash_kernel.install
```

### üåê Running with Google Colab

The notebooks can also be loaded using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), a hosted Jupyter notebook service from Google. To run these notebooks using Colab:

1. Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/) (you may need to log in with your Google account)
2. Click on `File ‚Üí Open Notebook`
3. Go to the `GitHub` tab and paste the repo URL: `https://github.com/gt-ospo/oss-training.git`
4. Click the search icon and select the notebook you wish to run
5. Use the `Runtime` tab to execute the notebook
