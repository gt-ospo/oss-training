# OSS Training from GT OSPO

![GT OSPO logo](img/logo-gt-ospo.png)

This repo contains topical training modules for getting started with open source software development.

The training modules are Jupyter Notebooks.  You can read them like a book, or you can download and run them interactively in a Jupyter session.

### Reading them

You can look at the training notebooks using the file browser in GitHub.  If GitHub's Jupyter notebook viewer misbehaves, you can use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/).  Here are direct links to the training notebooks through nbviewer:

- [Module 00: Interacting with Git and GitHub](https://nbviewer.org/github/gt-ospo/oss-training/blob/main/notebook-lessons/oss-module-00-interacting-with-git.ipynb)

### Running them

All training notebooks require the `jupyter` Python package.  Some may require additional packages (such as `bash_kernel`).  See the intro section of each notebook for details.  

#### Running notebooks using Google Collab

The notebooks here can also be loaded using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), a hosted Jupyter notebok service from Google. To run these notesbooks using Colab, please follow these steps:

1) Go to https://colab.research.google.com/. You may need to log in with your Google account to use Colab. 
2) Copy the https link under the **Code** tab.
    `https://github.com/gt-ospo/oss-training.git`
3) On Colab, go to `File -> Open Notebook`
4) Go to the `Github` tab and paste the repo https URL. Select the `Search` icon.
5) Select the notebook you wish to run.

7) You can then use the `Runtime` tab to run the notebook.
