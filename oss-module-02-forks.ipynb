    "## Getting Started\n",
    "This training module will introduce you to collaborative workflows on GitHub.  We will look at some real world workflows from the NumPy repo.  Then we will proceed with some exercies in the `gt-ospo` GitHub organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly recommended that you read [Module 1: Git](https://github.com/gt-ospo/oss-training/blob/main/oss-module-01-git.ipynb) before proceeding with this module.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The excercies at the end require you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Have Git on your computer\n",
    "2. Have a GitHub account\n",
    "3. Be a member of the gt-ospo Git organization\n",
    "\n",
    "## One size doesn't fit all!\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub offers a wealth of collaborative tools.  We are covering the most common ones today, which are well-documented on GitHub.  We expect most projects will make use of these tools.  However, many project's will use more, and some will use fewer, depending on the project.  Please defer to your project's maintainers about their workflows."

    "## What is an Issue?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we talk about actually contributing new code, let's talk about beginning the conversation with **Issues**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an issue, you are starting a conversation thread about a specific topic with the project's maintainers, uses, and other stakeholders.  Many projects will use issues for suggesting feature enhancements and reporting bugs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Issues have a huge number of benefits.  Here are just a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you want to contribute features or bugfixes to an existing project, you first want to make sure the changes are in the interests of the stakeholders.  You don't waste your time or the maintainers' time by developing code that is not of interest.  Starting with Issue can ensure that you and the stakeholders are on the same page before you start work.\n",
    "* They can be linked to Pull Requests, where new code is actually contributed.  More on that below...\n",
    "* It serves as a record of project development and bug reports.  Many times, when you encounter a bug in a project, you can search historical issues on GitHub to find an answer to your problem.\n",
    "* They are an excellent fit for project management.  Issues can tranlate to tasks and be tracked by project management tools, like a Kanban board.  Hence, even internal projects will often use Issues to track the internal team's work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GitHub docs have much more info in: [\"Tracking your work with Issues\"](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues)\n",
    "\n",
    "## About codes of conduct\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues are one of many ways to have conversations on GitHub.  As with any online conversations, mutual respect is crucial.  Most projects ([such as ours!](https://github.com/gt-ospo/vsip-summer-2024-projects/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)) have a code of conduct to help keep conversations respectful.  This makes sure everyone has productive (and hopefully fun!) experience.  \n"
