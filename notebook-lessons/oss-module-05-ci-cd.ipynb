    "## Why is CI/CD important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Integration and Continous Delivery (CI/CD) refers to an automation strategy for testing code within a codebase and then integrating the tested code into a product ready for use in a production environment. The primary benefit of CI/CD is that it allows for quick evaluation, integration, and deployment of a collaborative code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Continuous Integration** - refers to the automated process of testing and integrating new code. Typically with a GitHub based flow, code is tested from branches or remote forks and then integrated into the main code branch when it passes tests and code review. Packaging of the code into an executable format can also be part of the integration process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Continuous Delivery** - tested and approved code changes are staged and then pushed to the production environment.   \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Continuous Deployment** - refers to a process where production-ready code is automatically deployed after extensive automated testing. This is less common and mostly used for very mature codebases with high code coverage."

    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GitHub Actions** - the CI/CD infrastructure that supports build, test, and deploymen automation\n",
    "- **Action** - A piece of code that supports a common and repeatable task via the GH Actions framework. Typically Docker, Javascript, or composite and can be published as a GitHub App.\n",
    "- **Workflow** - An automated process that contains 1 or more jobs, usually written in a YAML file.\n",
    "- **Runner** - A server that executes a single job from a workflow. GitHub hosted runners include Linux, Windows, and MacOS, or you can also set up [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).\n",
    "- **Job** - A job is a set of steps that either runs a shell script or executes an action. Job steps are executed sequentially but separate jobs can be run in parallel using separate runners."
