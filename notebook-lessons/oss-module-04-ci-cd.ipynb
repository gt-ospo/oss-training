    "## Why is CI/CD important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Integration and Continous Delivery (CI/CD) refers to an automation strategy for testing code within a codebase and then integrating the tested code into a product ready for use in a production environment. The primary benefit of CI/CD is that it allows for quick evaluation, integration, and deployment of a collaborative code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Continuous Integration** - refers to the automated process of testing and integrating new code. Typically with a GitHub based flow, code is tested from branches or remote forks and then integrated into the main code branch when it passes tests and code review. Packaging of the code into an executable format can also be part of the integration process.\n",
    "* **Continuous Delivery** - tested and approved code changes are staged and then pushed to the production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ci-cd-pipeline](../img/lesson-04/git-ci-cd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Figure shows the typical workflow for a CI/CD pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Continuous Deployment** - refers to a process where production-ready code is automatically deployed after extensive automated testing. This is less common and mostly used for very mature codebases with high code coverage.\n",

    "## CI/CD Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "This training focuses on the use of [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), but there are several other popular CI/CD frameworks that you might encounter for the automation of code testing and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other CI Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different CI/CD frameworks that you could use. Other common frameworks for CI/CD that you might encounter include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) - self-contained, open source, and Java based; typically used for on-premise deployments\n",
    "- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)\n",
    "- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) - open source, Apache licensed Java Project Object Model framework\n",
    "- [Azure Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/architectures/devops-pipelines-baseline-architecture?view=azure-devops) - Microsofts DevOps framework that ties in with other MS Azure infrastructure\n",
    "- [Gitlab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) - integrated with Gitlab cloud instances and self-hosted Gitlab installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common CI/CD formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Many CI/CD frameworks use a common configuration format to specify the steps of a particular CI/CD workflow, typically YAML.   \n",
    "\n",
    "* To learn more about how GitHub Actions uses YAML see this [blog post](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).  \n",
    "* For a quick reference on how to specify certain parameters in YAML, see this [Learn YAML in X Minutes page](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/).\n",
    "  \n",
    "A simple YAML example for a GitHub Action that triggers on a `push` operation to the main branch might look as follows:  \n",
    "```yaml:\n",
    "on:\n",
    "  push:\n",
    "    branches:\n",
    "      - main\n",

    "# Investigating GitHub Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, we should define some common terminology for the [components of GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#the-components-of-github-actions).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GitHub Actions** - the CI/CD infrastructure that supports build, test, and deploymen automation\n",
    "- **Action** - A piece of code that supports a common and repeatable task via the GH Actions framework. Typically Docker, Javascript, or composite and can be published as a GitHub App.\n",
    "- **Workflow** - An automated process that contains 1 or more jobs, usually written in a YAML file.\n",
    "- **Runner** - A server that executes a single job from a workflow. GitHub hosted runners include Linux, Windows, and Linux, or you can also set up [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).\n",
    "- **Job** - A job is a set of steps that either runs a shell script or executes an action. Job steps are executed sequentially but separate jobs can be run in parallel using separate runners.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows are typically specified in the top-level directory `.github/workflows`. We will incrementally improve a `test` YAML file from our [sample repo](https://github.com/gt-ospo/testing_ci_cd/) to investigate the pieces of a typical workflow.\n",
