## What is open source governance?

*Governance* describes the decision-making that an open source projects need to function. This is how policies and processes are defined.  Some examples of policies are:

* **Roles and responsibilities**
  - Who gets to do what?
* **Accepting code**
  - What are the policies to ensure code stability and quality?
  - What are the policies to ensure supply-chain security?
* **Releasing code?**
  - What are the criteria for a stable release?
  - What is the release cadence?
* **Getting new contributors involved**
  - Is the contributor qualified?
  - Is the contributor trusted?
* **Communication**
  - How do users report bugs and feature requests?
  - Who can speak on behalf of the project?
  - How are interpersonal disputes resolved?
 
There is no one-size-fits-all solution

## Models of Governance

Models of governance differ primarily on:
* Who gets to make decisions
* How decisions get made

## Cathedral vs. Bazaar

An older model, first described in Linux community around 1999.  Describes both **governance** (who gets to make decisions) and **contribution** (who gets to add new code).

![chapel_and_bazaar](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/img/governancevcontrib.png)

* Two extremes of **governance**:
  - Benevolent Dictator: Single individual or organization makes policy decisions
  - Meritocracy: Ability to make decisions is given to significant contributors
* Two extremes of **contribution**:
  - Bazaar: Project accepts code from many external developers
  - Cathedral: Project has a group of core developers

## Five Recent Models

Many recent OSS advocates describe 5 models:

1. Do-ocracy (a.k.a Meritocracy)
2. Founder-leader (a.k.a, Benevolent Dictator for Life, )
3. Self-appointed technical council
4. Electoral
5. Vendor-backed
6. Foundation-backed

Not mutually-exclusive.  Within one project, different policies may be decided through different models.  

### 1. Do-ocracy

* The people doing the work are the ones making decisions
  - Often no formal governance.  Just implicit governance in group's interactions
  - Usually still have contribution guidelines (peer review of code, etc.)

#### Example

* Apache Web Server: https://httpd.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html
  
#### Pros
* Easy for small teams with few stakeholders

#### Cons
* Decision-making usually does not scale with more contributors and stakeholders
* Can be difficult for newcomers to integrate with the project

### 2. Founder-leader (BDFL)

* One person who started the project is the ultimate decision-maker
* Leader determines projects priorities and vision, settles disputes among other
    contributors, and decides which contributions are merged

#### Examples
* Linux and Linus Torvalds
* Python and Guido van Rossum : a BDFL early-on, and van Rossum is still "honorary" BDFL.
  But now has foundation-backed governance

#### Pros
* Easy for small teams with few stakeholders
* Common for most projects to start this way
* A humble, inclusive, constructive leader can set a positive tone
    for how community can function.
  
#### Cons
* Does not scale with more contributors and stakeholders
  - Problems with patches getting dropped were a frequent complaint in Linux until
    Torvalds distributed responsibilities more [see examples in mailing list archives](https://lwn.net/2002/0131/a/patch-penguin.php3)
  - A BDFL may not-be-so-benevolent.  Contributors who have disputes with founder do not have other
    recourse, and projects can get forked.
  - Founders' personal views may affect public perception of project.

### 3. Self-appointed technical council

- A small group determine's project priorities, decides which
  contributions will be merged, ...
- The council also decides who will be added to the council
- A midpoint between Meritocracy and Founder-leader model
- Many names for group: technical council, steering committee, ...

#### Examples

* The Apache Software Foundation: https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/
  - Several councils with different roles/responsibilities.  Mostly business, stakeholder relations, etc.
  - Individual software projects are meritocratic
* OpenAPI: https://www.openapis.org/participate/how-to-contribute/governance
  - A open standard, not an actual piece of software
  - Several councils with different roles/responsibilities: Technical Steering Committee,
    Technical Oversight Committee, Business Governance Board
* Councils are quite common with open standards

#### Pros

* Scales better for larger projects with many stakeholders
* Decision-making is efficient

#### Cons

* Member selection process may exclusionary
* May create self-reinforcing leadership structure
* May create disconnect between leadership and community

### 4. Electoral

### 5. Single-vendor Backed

A company may decide to open source a project for a variety of reasons
- Releasing open source code that seems useful to the community
- Providing an early version of a product to gauge user interest and engagement. 
  * E.g., Kubernetes was released by Google and user interest led to the creation of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation
- Creating a "freemium" version of a product

Community contributions are welcomed but the vision for the project is typically controlled by one stakeholder
- Over time, governance may shift to another model as community engagement grows

#### Examples

- Kubernetes: https://kubernetes.io/community/
- Android
- MySQL

Hard to find docs re: governance...

#### Pros
- Similar to Founder-Leader but with a larger amount of resources behind development
- Quality of open source code benefits from professional software engineer support

#### Cons
- Similar to Founder-Leader, a company's vision for a project may differ from that of the community
- Lack of investment from the vendor can cause the project to stagnate and lose community involvement

### 6. Foundation-backed

Open-source projects often hit a glass ceiling, with many of the following attributes:

* It’s not clear how a project is funded or how it operates, or there is a perception that it primarily benefits a single vendor
* There isn’t a neutral owner of assets, such as the project name, logo, domain names, social accounts, and other assets
* The copyright holder of the project is a single entity, giving them unilateral control to change the license and intellectual property policies without the community’s input
* Vendors leveraging the technology don’t feel they have a space to fairly collaborate, especially if they are competitors
* The legal, fiduciary, and financial aspects of the project are managed by one organization without transparency or given processes


#### Examples

* Python Language Foundation:  https://www.python.org/psf/about/
* Rust Foundation:  https://foundation.rust-lang.org/about/
* PHP Foundation:  https://thephp.foundation/foundation/
* Ruby Central:  https://thephp.foundation/foundation/

#### Pros

* Solves the above-mentioned issues

#### Cons
* It's a lot of work to form a legal entity
  - Funding: The bove-mentioned projects are non-profit entities backed by donations and/or corporate sponsorship
  - Staffing: Usually need committed staff to operate
* Solution: Can integrate your project in an umbrella council or foundation
  - Apache Software Foundation
  - Linux Foundation
