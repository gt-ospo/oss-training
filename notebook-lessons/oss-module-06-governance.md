## What is open source governance?

*Governance* describes the decision-making that an open source projects need to function. This is how policies and processes are defined.  Some examples of policies are:

* **Roles and responsibilities**
  - Who gets to do what?
* **Accepting code**
  - What are the policies to ensure code stability and quality?
  - What are the policies to ensure supply-chain security?
* **Releasing code?**
  - What are the criteria for a stable release?
  - What is the release cadence?
* **Getting new contributors involved**
  - Is the contributor qualified?
  - Is the contributor trusted?
* **Communication**
  - How do users report bugs and feature requests?
  - Who can speak on behalf of the project?
  - How are interpersonal disputes resolved?
 
There is no one-size-fits-all solution

## Models of Governance

Models of governance differ primarily on:
* Who gets to make decisions
* How decisions get made

### Cathedral vs. Bazaar

An older model, first described in Linux community around 1999.  Describes both **governance** (who gets to make decisions) and **contribution** (who gets to add new code).

* Two extremes of **governance**:
  - Benevolent Dictator: Single individual or organization makes policy decisions
  - Meritocracy: Ability to make decisions is given to significant contributors
* Two extremes of **contribution**:
  - Bazaar: Project accepts code from many external developers
  - Cathedral: Project has a group of core developers

### Five Recent Models

Many recent OSS advocates describe 5 models:

1. Do-ocracy (a.k.a Meritocracy)
2. Founder-leader (a.k.a, Benevolent Dictator for Life)
3. Technical council
4. Electoral
5. Vendor-backed
6. Foundation-backed
