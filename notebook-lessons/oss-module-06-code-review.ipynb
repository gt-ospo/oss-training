    "## What is a Code Review?\n",
    "\n",
    "A code review is a manual process whereby a developer and a set of their peers review proposed changes to a codebase. Reviewers examine the changelist for code to be committed and determine (along with output from automated tests) whether the code improves the quality of the codebase.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### When and How do Code Reviews Happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Code reviews can happen anytime that code is pushed to a production-related branch or repository. Some larger projects have specific rules that require a certain number of code reviews (usually 1-3 reviewers) in addition to automated testing and checks for code style. As an example, some companies might require two reviews for user-facing changes (i.e. to a web app that is publicly available) or even three reviews (e.g., two peer reviews and one manager) for critical internal applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general the process is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Developer submits a pull request to merge new code. They can request\n",
    "specific reviewers.\n",
    "2. Automated tests check to see if code is functionally correct.\n",
    "3. Linters can check for added errors and style issues\n",
    "4. Reviewers look over the code and possibly test it in their own environment.\n",
    "5. Reviewers suggest any changes for the developer to make.\n",
    "6. Developer updates their PR (if needed)\n",
    "7. Code is merged, or the iterative process goes back to 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example from Open Liberty, we see that two automated tests completed correctly but one manual review is needed to merge the new code.\n",
    "\n",
    "![openliberty_example_review](https://github.com/gt-ospo/oss-training/blob/main/img/lesson-05/openliberty-github-pr-review.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Do We Need Code Reviews?\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in previous lectures, automated testing can be a very valuable tool to check if code is correct before it is merged into a larger project. However, it's very tough to get 100% test coverage, and tests can be flawed and might miss some key corner case that is not covered by a test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code review provides an important human element to double-check that updates to a code are valid and useful!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reviews also provide good opportunities for collaboration, mentoring, and team building in addition to the benefits of integrating \"correct\" code."

    "## What Makes a Good Code Review?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many good resources on how to do a good code review, like Google's [Standard of Code Review](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/standard.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general a good code review process will follow these practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A good pull request from the programmer should be complete and easy to parse\n",
    "  * Include a description of what the changes do, testing instructions, and screenshots for GUi-related behaviors\n",
    "* Code reviews should encompass small changelists. That is, a programmer should submit changelists that can be easily reviewed and reviewers should be prompt in their review of submitted code.\n",
    "  * Size of changes varies but many developers suggest a changelist that can be reviewed in less than an hour or 200 lines of code\n",
    "  * Consider splitting CLs along function or file boundaries to make code easier to review.\n",
    "* Automate where possible!\n",
    "  * Automating functionality tests and style checks saves both the developer and reviewer time in the review process.\n",
    "* Communication is important for both authors and reviewers\n",
    "  * Authors should clearly communicate changes and address comments in a timely fashion\n",
    "     * Review guides for [writing good CL descriptions for commits](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/cl-descriptions.html)\n",
    "  * Reviewers should review code in a timely fashion and be considerate of the author's effort and time\n",
    "     * Code examples or references to guides can be used to convey how to modify or update CLs\n",
    "* Issues of code style (ie, how many spaces are needed) should be resolved using an agreed upon [style guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide), not by personal preference.\n",
    "  * [Google Style Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/)\n",
    "  * [PEP 8 Python Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)\n",
