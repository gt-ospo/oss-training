    "*[Prepared by the OpenSource@Stanford team (Zach Chandler, Francesca Vera)](https://zenodo.org/records/15678444)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. 📜 Choose a License\n",
    "- **Critical First Step**: Make sure all contributors on the team agree before you commit\n",
    "- **Stanford OTL Recommended Licenses**:\n",
    "  - **Permissive**: MIT, BSD 1-, 2-, and 3-clause (often best for academic use)\n",
    "  - **Copyleft**: GPL v2 or LGPL v3\n",
    "  - **Non-code projects**: Creative Commons\n",
    "- **Academic Consideration**: At Stanford, no permission needed to publish to public domain (varies by institution)\n",
    "- **Commercialization**: If there's a chance you might commercialize, consult your tech transfer office\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. 🔍 Be Clear & Discoverable\n",
    "Your repository should have:\n",
    "- ✅ **LICENSE.md*** \n",
    "- ✅ **README.md*** (a good one!)\n",
    "- ✅ **CONTRIBUTING.md***\n",
    "- ✅ **Contributor recognition**\n",
    "- ✅ **Code of conduct**\n",
    "\n",
    "*\\*doesn't have to be a markdown file*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. 🏷️ Use Versioning\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: Discrete software versions help with reproducibility (your paper was published at a particular moment, but software keeps evolving)\n",
    "- **Version Schema**: Use semantic versioning (v.1.1.1) to help track progress and provide clarity to users\n",
    "- **GitHub Integration**: Use GitHub \"Releases\" feature for easy version management\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. 🎯 Get a DOI\n",
    "- **Persistence & Credit**: Secure a Digital Object Identifier for your project using Zenodo/GitHub integration\n",
    "- **Per-Version DOIs**: Assign a unique DOI per version for precise citation\n",
    "- **Easy Setup**: GitHub→Zenodo is the simplest approach (though other institutional services may be preferred)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5. 📚 Make It Easy to Cite\n",
    "- **CITATION.cff File**: Create a CITATION.cff file at the top level of your repository\n",
    "- **GitHub Integration**: Note the .cff file extension - GitHub has special affordances for parsing and display\n",

    "## ✅ Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Key Takeaways\n",
    "- Open source projects evolve naturally; sustainability should be built into every phase.\n",
    "- GitHub provides powerful tools for automation, community, and transparency.\n",
    "- You can evaluate your OSS sustainability with a few API calls.\n",
    "- Archive with dignity: good open source is remembered even after it's inactive.\n",
    "- Community engagement is critical for long-term sustainability.\n",
    "- **Federal projects** can benefit from specialized tools like DSACMS repo-scaffolder for compliance.\n",
    "- **Academic projects** should follow the 6 key practices from OpenSource@Stanford for immediate improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "- Run the analysis tool on your project.\n",
    "- Address recommendations provided by the tool.\n",
    "- Add missing sustainability features (LICENSE, README, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.).\n",
    "- Encourage contributions through community practices.\n",
    "- Plan for the archive phase with clear documentation and guidance.\n",
    "- **For federal projects**: Consider using DSACMS repo-scaffolder templates.\n",
    "- **For academic projects**: Implement the Stanford OpenSource team's 6 recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📜 Choosing a License\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selecting the right license is crucial for the success of your open source project!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Corporate Use**: Apache 2.0 license is often preferred due to its permissive nature and explicit patent grant, fostering trust and legal clarity.\n",
    "- **For Copyleft Projects**: GNU GPL enforces strong copyleft (all future modifications must be open source), while LGPL offers more flexibility (allows linking with proprietary software).\n",
    "- **For Academic Use**: Permissive licenses (MIT, BSD) are often the best choice.\n",
    "- **For Non-code Projects**: Creative Commons licenses are recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must choose a license that aligns with your project's goals and community values! If you're unsure, consider using the [ChooseALicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) tool to help you select the right license for your project - and reach out to [GT's OSPO for guidance](https://ospo.cc.gatech.edu/)!"
