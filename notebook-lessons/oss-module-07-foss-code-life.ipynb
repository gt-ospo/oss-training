    "## ‚úÖ Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Key Takeaways\n",
    "- Open source projects evolve naturally; sustainability should be built into every phase.\n",
    "- GitHub provides powerful tools for automation, community, and transparency.\n",
    "- You can evaluate your OSS sustainability with a few API calls.\n",
    "- Archive with dignity: good open source is remembered even after it's inactive.\n",
    "- Community engagement is critical for long-term sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üöÄ Next Steps\n",
    "- Run the analysis tool on your project.\n",
    "- Address recommendations provided by the tool.\n",
    "- Add missing sustainability features.\n",
    "- Encourage contributions through community practices.\n",
    "- Plan for the archive phase with clear documentation and guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìú Choosing a License\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selecting the right license is crucial for the success of your open source project!\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your project is intended for corporate use or collaboration, the Apache 2.0 license is often a preferred choice due to its permissive nature and explicit patent grant, which fosters trust and legal clarity. \n",
    "- On the other hand, copyleft licenses like the GNU GPL and LGPL are ideal when you want to ensure that derivative works remain open source. The GNU GPL enforces strong copyleft, requiring all future modifications to be open source under the same license, while the LGPL offers a more flexible approach, allowing linking with proprietary software. \n",
    "- You must choose a license that aligns with your project's goals and community values! If you're unsure, consider using the [ChooseALicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) tool to help you select the right license for your project - and reach out to the OSPO for guidance!"
