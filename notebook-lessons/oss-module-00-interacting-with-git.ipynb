    "\n",
    "Welcome to the GT OSPO VSIP!  This training module will introduce you to concepts of Git, especially related to branching and merging.  Understanding Git branching/merging will be essential to your success in as code contributor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### How should I use this training module?\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll get the most out of this module if you follow-along interactively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can download this Jupyter notebook and work directly inside it.  Make sure you have the `jupyter`, `jupyterlab`, and `bash_kernel` Python modules installed.  **Don't forget the second step with `python -m bash_kernel.install`!**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Console\n",
    "$ pip install jupyter jupyterlab bash_kernel\n",
    "$ python -m bash_kernel.install\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are not installing Jupyter or `bash_kernel`, you can also follow-along in any standalone terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can I do this training in VS Code (or PyCharm or Cursor or ...)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Good question!  We love our IDEs, we use Git integrations in our IDEs all the time, and so should you.  **But** it really helps to know how to precisely use Git in the command line, especially if your IDE isn't doing exactly what you want.  Trust us, it can really help you out of a jam.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Git IDE integrations use the same terminology as Git on the command line (push, fetch, pull, etc.), so all your new knowledge will be transferrable to your favorite IDE.  \n"

    "## Installing Git\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub has excellent instructions for installing Git on macOS, Windows, and Linux:  https://github.com/git-guides/install-git\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on Windows, be sure include the 'Git Bash' terminal during the installation (it should be selected by default).  You can use Git Bash to follow-along with this tutorial.  If you are on macOS or Linux, you can use any terminal to follow-along.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First-time Git Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing Git, you should set your username an email.  These will be used to identify changes that you've made to a Git repo.  In the terminal run `git config` with your own name email:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git config --global user.name 'George Burdell'\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `user.name` is arbitrary and is only for the benefit of other humans.  However, the `user.email` is quite important when you're working with GitHub, GitLab, or another service.  This email is used to link your GitHub account to any commits in a Git repo.  It's not a bad idea to use a `user.email` that you'll have access to forever, instead of your GT email.  This will ensure that you can always keep your GitHub account linked to commits in Git repos.   \n",
    "\n",

    "## Setting up SSH Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Git, there are several method to authenticate with GitHub.  These days, username/password is *not* one of those methods!  A well-accepted, simple, and secure method is via SSH.  To setup your computer and GitHub for SSH authentication, follow these steps:\n",

    "1. [Check for existing SSH keys on your computer](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)\n",

    "3. [Add an SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).  For this purpose, register it as an \"authentication\" key (not a \"signing\" key)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested, there is much more info in the GitHub docs, [\"Connecting to GitHub with SSH\"](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using an SSH Key to Sign Commits\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, GitHub exposes several ways to spoof commit authors.  For example, as of a few years ago, [the first commit in the Linux GitHub repo did not belong to Linus Torvald's GitHub account](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/t24z4f/why_is_the_first_commit_in_the_gitgit_repo_not_by/).  Signed commits were introduced as a way to prove authorship, and many open source projects now require signed commits.\n",

    "If you already generated an SSH key, you can use the same key for signing commits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Add an SSH key to your GitHub account (again)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).  This time, register it as a \"signing\" key (not an \"authentication\" key)\n",

    "## What is Git?\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is the most widely used **version control system (VCS)** today.  Any VCS uses a database to record changes to a set of files over time, such as the source files in a software project.  The changes over time are called the **version history**.  Using the database, you can retrieve specific **versions** of files from any point in history.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/it-worked-yesterday.png\" width=\"200\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Git's biggest advantages is to make **collaboration** easier.  By using a branching workflow (which we'll discuss below), multiple developers can work independently on the same codebase.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of any VCS is the ability to **respond to bugs**.  If your app is in production, and a bug is discovered, then you can revert the app to a previous stable while you investigate the cause.  The VCS also helps you discover which **specific change and developer** instroduced the bug.  The intent is not to blame or shame anyone.  Rather, the idea is that the developer who introduced the bug is the one who is most likely to know that part of the codebase and respond to that bug quickly."
