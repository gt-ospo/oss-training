    "\n",
    "#### 1. Choose a License\n",
    "- **Critical First Step**: Make sure all contributors on the team agree before you commit\n",
    "- **Stanford OTL Recommended Licenses**:\n",
    "  - **Permissive**: MIT, BSD 1-, 2-, and 3-clause (often best for academic use)\n",
    "  - **Copyleft**: GPL v2 or LGPL v3\n",
    "  - **Non-code projects**: Creative Commons\n",
    "- **Academic Consideration**: At Stanford, no permission needed to publish to public domain (varies by institution)\n",
    "- **Commercialization**: If there's a chance you might commercialize, consult your tech transfer office\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Be Clear & Discoverable\n",
    "Your repository should have:\n",
    "- ✅ **LICENSE.md*** \n",
    "- ✅ **README.md*** (a good one!)\n",
    "- ✅ **CONTRIBUTING.md***\n",
    "- ✅ **Contributor recognition**\n",
    "- ✅ **Code of conduct**\n",

    "#### 3. Use Versioning\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: Discrete software versions help with reproducibility (your paper was published at a particular moment, but software keeps evolving)\n",
    "- **Version Schema**: Use semantic versioning (v.1.1.1) to help track progress and provide clarity to users\n",
    "- **GitHub Integration**: Use GitHub \"Releases\" feature for easy version management\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Get a DOI\n",
    "- **Persistence & Credit**: Secure a Digital Object Identifier for your project using Zenodo/GitHub integration\n",
    "- **Per-Version DOIs**: Assign a unique DOI per version for precise citation\n",
    "- **Easy Setup**: GitHub→Zenodo is the simplest approach (though other institutional services may be preferred)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 5. Make It Easy to Cite\n",
    "- **CITATION.cff File**: Create a CITATION.cff file at the top level of your repository\n",

    "### Understanding Dependency Abandonment and Supply Chain Trust\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent software engineering research has shed light on critical challenges in open source ecosystem sustainability. As open source projects grow, they become increasingly interdependent, creating complex supply chains where the abandonment of a single dependency can have cascading effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Research Areas\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. When Does Dependency Abandonment Matter?\n",
    "**Miller, et al. \"Designing Abandabot: When Does Open Source Dependency Abandonment Matter?\"** *ICSE 2026*\n",
    "\n",
    "This research investigates:\n",
    "- **Triggers of Abandonment**: What causes maintainers to stop actively developing a project?\n",
    "- **Risk Assessment**: Which abandoned dependencies pose the greatest risk to downstream projects?\n",
    "- **Early Warning Systems**: How can we identify projects at risk of abandonment before it happens?\n",
    "- **Mitigation Strategies**: What approaches help projects survive when their dependencies are abandoned?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Trust in Open Source Supply Chains\n",
    "**Boughton, et al. \"Decomposing and Measuring Trust in Open-Source Software Supply Chains\"** *ICSE-NIER 2024*\n",
    "\n",
    "This work provides frameworks for understanding and measuring trust:\n",
    "- **Trust Factors**: Transparency, security practices, community engagement, and maintainer reliability\n",
    "- **Supply Chain Visibility**: How to identify and evaluate the trustworthiness of dependencies\n",
    "- **Risk Evaluation**: Assessing the stability and health of projects you depend on\n",
    "- **Governance Impact**: How different governance models affect trust and reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Ecosystem Response to Abandonment  \n",
    "**Miller, et al. \"Understanding the Response to Open-Source Dependency Abandonment in the npm Ecosystem\"** *ICSE 2025*\n",
    "\n",
    "This study analyzes real-world responses in the npm ecosystem:\n",
    "- **Community Adaptations**: How projects adapt when dependencies are abandoned (forking, vendoring, migration)\n",
    "- **Response Timeline**: How quickly does the ecosystem respond to abandonment?\n",
    "- **Success Factors**: What determines whether a project successfully navigates dependency abandonment?\n",
    "- **Ecosystem Health**: Metrics for measuring ecosystem resilience to abandonment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Implications for Your Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating OSS dependencies and building sustainable projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Monitor Dependency Health**: Use tools to track the activity level and health of upstream dependencies\n",
    "2. **Plan for Alternatives**: Identify backup solutions or forks for critical dependencies\n",
    "3. **Engage with Maintainers**: Build relationships and communicate about dependency stability\n",
    "4. **Document Assumptions**: Make explicit what versions and behaviors your project depends on\n",
    "5. **Support Maintainers**: Consider supporting the maintenance of critical dependencies through funding or contributions\n",
    "6. **Plan for Succession**: Ensure your own project has plans for graceful transition if abandonment occurs\n"

    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "- Open source projects evolve naturally; sustainability should be built into every phase.\n",
    "- GitHub provides powerful tools for automation, community, and transparency.\n",
    "- You can evaluate your OSS sustainability with a few API calls.\n",
    "- Archive with dignity: good open source is remembered even after it's inactive.\n",
    "- Community engagement is critical for long-term sustainability.\n",
    "- **Federal projects** can benefit from specialized tools like DSACMS repo-scaffolder for compliance.\n",
    "- **Academic projects** should follow the 6 key practices from OpenSource@Stanford for immediate improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- Run the analysis tool on your project.\n",
    "- Address recommendations provided by the tool.\n",
    "- Add missing sustainability features (LICENSE, README, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.).\n",
    "- Encourage contributions through community practices.\n",
    "- Plan for the archive phase with clear documentation and guidance.\n",
    "- **For federal projects**: Consider using DSACMS repo-scaffolder templates.\n",
    "- **For academic projects**: Implement the Stanford OpenSource team's 6 recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're a Georgia Tech community member, [join LibreTech Collective!](https://ltc.gtorg.gatech.edu/) LibreTech is the only student-led organization that promotes open-technology development and collaboration at Georgia Tech. It's a great way to connect with like-minded individuals, contribute to open source projects, and learn more about sustainability practices in the open source ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also request to publish your project on the [LibreLinker website](https://librelinker.us), which is a platform for sharing and discovering open-technology projects within the Georgia Tech community with LibreTech's support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing a License\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the right license is crucial for the success of your open source project!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Corporate Use**: Apache 2.0 license is often preferred due to its permissive nature and explicit patent grant, fostering trust and legal clarity.\n",
    "- **For Copyleft Projects**: GNU GPL enforces strong copyleft (all future modifications must be open source), while LGPL offers more flexibility (allows linking with proprietary software).\n",
    "- **For Academic Use**: Permissive licenses (MIT, BSD) are often the best choice.\n",
    "- **For Non-code Projects**: Creative Commons licenses are recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must choose a license that aligns with your project's goals and community values! If you're unsure, consider using the [ChooseALicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) tool to help you select the right license for your project - and reach out to [GT's OSPO for guidance](https://ospo.cc.gatech.edu/)!"
